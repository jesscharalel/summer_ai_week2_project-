This assignment truly was a challenge, considering I have little to no experience with python. Despite my lack of experience, I found that writing pseudocode maybe 10 times over to get the concept in my head helped immensely. The TAs of the class also boosted my confidence in this assignment, specifically Nick who took the time to explain depth first search pseudocode step by step! In summary, even though the assignment seemed daunting at first, I was able to finish it with ease with the numerous tools at my disposal.
